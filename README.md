# [lstm]()

> Long Short Term Memory

A port of a [LSTM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Long_short-term_memory) network that was originally written in python by [Nicolas D. Jimenez](https://github.com/nicodjimenez/lstm)

This was created as a learning tool since I find it easier to understand code than to understand the math behind LSTM; math symbols look like jibberish.

[numjs](https://github.com/nicolaspanel/numjs) is used in place of [numpy](https://www.numpy.org/) as you need to be able to do operations on matrices. 
See `numpy.js`

Its not fast, it was intented to look like the original to make it easer to consume if you are coming from python world. It looks identical to the original, only in JS.

## Usage

1) Install dependencies

```
npm i
```

2) Run `test.js`

```
node test
```

3) Study `test.js` && `lstm.js`

Enjoy!
